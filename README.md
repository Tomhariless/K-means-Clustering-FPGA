A Hitstogram-based K-means Clustering on FPGA

It is a K-means Clustering implementation on FPGA using Vivado HLS for Xilinx Zedboard
The K-means Clustering itself is implemented in Vivado HLS 2016.4 and the test system on the zedboard is using Vivado 2016.4
The image is sent through a OV7060 camera or through a AXI-DMA, and put the result through a VGA.
